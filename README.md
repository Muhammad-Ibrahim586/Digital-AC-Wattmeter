# Digital AC Wattmeter

## Overview
This project involves the design and simulation of a Digital AC Wattmeter using Proteus. The wattmeter is designed to measure the power consumption of AC devices, demonstrating the application of circuit analysis and digital design principles.

## Features
1) Accurate simulation of power measurement.
2) Designed using Proteus for real-world feasibility.
3) Includes a detailed report explaining the circuit design and functionality.

## Files Included
1) **Proteus-Simulation/**: Contains the `.pdsprj` file for the simulation.
2) **Report**: A comprehensive report detailing the project.

## Applications
1) Power monitoring in electrical systems.
2) Understanding AC circuit behavior and digital measurement techniques.

## Instructions
1. Download the repository.
2. Open the Proteus file using Proteus Design Suite.
3. Run the simulation to observe the wattmeter in action.
4. Refer to the report for a complete understanding of the project.
